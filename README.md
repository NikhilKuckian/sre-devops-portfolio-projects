# SRE, DevOps & Cloud Engineering Portfolio
This repository showcases my hands-on projects in **Linux, Python, AWS, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Ansible, and CI/CD**. 
During interviews, it is not possible to show proof of projects done for companies. The projects here are just for demo purposes. 
**Please note that all the code is written by me and none of these are from any company code base.** I have tried to create a personalized demo version of a working project from my corporate experience for study and practice purposes.
Each project includes:
- Working code
- Documentation (README)
