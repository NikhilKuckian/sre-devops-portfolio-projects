# Git Branching Workflow
## ðŸš€ Overview
This project documents a **Git workflow** for DevOps teams to collaborate efficiently.  
The strategy prevents broken code from reaching production and ensures proper code review before merge.
## ðŸ”„ Branching Strategy
- **main** â†’ production-ready  
- **dev** â†’ integration branch for testing  
- **feature/** â†’ short-lived branches for new tasks/features  
## ðŸ“Œ Workflow Example
1. Create feature branch: `feature/log-rotation-enhancement`
2. Commit and push changes
3. Open Pull Request â†’ target `dev`
4. Once validated, merge `dev` â†’ `main`
## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits
- Prevents breaking `main`
- Enables peer review
- Clear history and traceability
- Fits well with Jenkins/GitHub Actions CI pipelines
## ðŸ§  Interview Angle
**Q: How do you manage Git workflows in a DevOps team?**  
**A:**
- Use branching model with `main` (prod), `dev` (integration), and `feature/*` (task).  
- Protect `main` branch, require PRs + approvals.  
- Combined with CI/CD, this ensures only tested code reaches production.
