# Flashcards – Git Workflow
**Q1:** Why do we use feature branches?  
**A1:** To isolate work, avoid breaking `main`, and simplify code reviews.
**Q2:** What is a protected branch in GitHub?  
**A2:** A branch with rules that prevent direct pushes and require PRs + approvals.
**Q3:** Difference between Git merge and Git rebase?  
**A3:** Merge preserves history (new commit), rebase rewrites history (clean linear timeline).
**Q4:** STAR story: “Tell me about a time you set up Git workflow.”  
**A4:** Standardized branching strategy (`main/dev/feature`), protected main, enforced PR reviews, integrated with Jenkins. Reduced conflicts, improved reliability.
